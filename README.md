:beer: :computer: Demo React App using the Brewdog API (https://punkapi.com/)

Findings: 

Given more time, TDD as a general rule of thumb inclusive of snapshot testing for react components. Would have added axios (as well as axios' mock adapter) to create my middleware logic to grab data from the brewdog API for use within the Redux thunks. 

Enzyme to unit test user interaction. 

TODO:-
1. Checkout implementation and logic
2. Navigation Logic
3. Cicking through Sub-Headings

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
